========================================================

- Nowadays, the government hospitals are congested with the patients that waiting for treatment. As the Malaysian population is steadily increases every year, there is a need to upgrade the existing hospitals or newly build other hospitals.

- The critical chronic deceases such as heart failure, kidney problem etc. are increase in Malaysia. As population increases, the deceases are expected to increase as well causing congestion to current government hospitals.

- To justify the location to build new public healthcare services.

Objective
========================================================

- To build a shiny web app that mapped Malaysia population for every district with the marker to show hospitals location.

Target Users
========================================================

- The application can be used by policy makers or related government agencies in order to know the current situation happening to every district on the healthcare needs.

- Based from that they may proceed with initial decision to upgrade or build another hospitals based from the population of particular district and the surrounding district.

Conclusion
========================================================

- The app is an initial idea to map on government's public facilities (in this case, hospitals and clinic1M) vs. the population. In can be affectively used by government agencies for looking on the trend of the needs of hospitals in particular districts in Malaysia.

- From our own initial observation, there are some distict that may need to revise for additional hospital as to accomodate high concentration of population such as Batu Pahat, Alor Setar, Sg Petani, Kota Bharu, Pasir Mas, Seremban, Kuantan, Lahad Datu, Tawau , Miri and Sibu.

- In future, the app can be upgraded to add more on government's public facilities such as main roads, bus stations, schools etc for the purpose of monitoring and planning (provided with the data is available).
